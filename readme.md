# Furni - Furniture eCommerce Website
This project is a work in progress for an HTML and CSS-based furniture eCommerce website.

## Features (Implemented):
Basic HTML structure for the website layout
CSS styling for a clean and visually appealing design (may not be fully responsive yet)

## Features (To Be Implemented):
Responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across different screen sizes
Full eCommerce functionality (product listings, shopping cart, checkout, etc.) - likely using JavaScript
Additional HTML elements and CSS styles to enhance the user experience

## Project Setup:
Download or clone the project repository.
Open the index.html file in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) or a web browser (Microsoft Edge or Chrome are recommended).
Set your browser zoom level to 100% or 90% to view the current layout as intended (responsiveness is still under development).

## Notes:
This project is currently in its early stages and may not be fully functional yet.
The focus is on creating a solid foundation with HTML and CSS before adding interactivity (JavaScript).

## Viewing the Project:
Code Editor: Open index.html in your preferred code editor for a detailed view of the HTML and CSS code.
Web Browser: Open index.html in Microsoft Edge or Chrome (set zoom to 100% or 90%) to see the rendered website layout.
